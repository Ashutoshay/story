    <h1>The <u><b>Tiger</b></u> And The <u><b>Lion</b></u></h1>
            <p>A <u><b>Tiger</b></u> was making fun of the <u><b>Lion</b></u> one day for being so slow.</p>

           <p> "Do you ever get anywhere?"he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>

            <p>"<u><b>Yes</b>,</u>"replied the <u><b>Lion</b></u> than i think.I'll run you a race prove it."</p>

            <p>The <u><b>Tiger</b></u> was much <u><b>alarmed</b></u> at the idea of running a race with the <u><b>Lion</b></u>.but for the fun of the thing he agreed.So the <u><b>Dog</b>.</u>who had consented to act as judge,marked the distance yelled,<b><u>example</u></b>.</p>

            <p>The <b><u>Tiger</u></b> was soon far out of sight,and to make the <b><u>Lion</u></b> feel very deeply how rediculous it was for him to try a race with a <b><u>Tiger</u></b>.he went off the course to practice <b><u>runing</u></b> for <b><u>2</u></b> hours until the <b><u>Lion</u></b> should catch up.</p>

           
           <p> The <b><u>Lion</u></b>  meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily. and,after a time,passed the place where the <b><u>Tiger</u></b> was <b><u>runing</u></b> .The <b><u>Tiger</u></b> was so caught up in <b><u>runing</u></b>;and when at last he did stop, the <b><u>Lion</u></b> was near the goal.The <b><u>Tiger</u></b> now ran his swiftesy,but he could not overtake the <b><u>Lion</u></b>  in time.</p>
